# 📘 Machine Learning Tasks

## **Task 1: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

**Objective:**  
To predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using **Linear Regression** with a **self-created dataset**.

**Dataset:**  
- Type: Custom CSV dataset  
- Features: `sqft`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`  
- Target: `price`

**Outcome:**  
The model successfully predicts house prices based on input features.
